# llsifclient

This Python package partially implements the client side APIs of Love Live School Idol Festival (Japanese Android edition), a free-to-play mobile game.

Enough bits are implemented so you can register new accounts, use and issue transfer codes, do free and premium recruits and manage your deck.

**NOTE: This package is not ready to use out of the box!** I have not included the HMAC key used to authenticate each API call, so the production server will reject most calls. Read the comments for details.
